# OBS macOS Background Removal

## Introduction

This plugin provides a filter to remove a persons background using macOS' built-in [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) API.

macOS 12 and OBS 28 (or newer) are required.

## Getting started

To get started, download and run the installer from the [releases](https://github.com/gxalpha/obs-mac-backgroundremoval/releases) page. It's currently not signed or notarized (that would cost me 99â‚¬ per year, which at this time I'm not looking to pay), so to open it you may have to do `Right Click -> Open` instead of double-clicking.
The filter can be found in the filters window under "Effect Filters". This means that it can be used on any type of source, not just Video Capture Devices.

## License and Thanks
This plugin is licensed under the terms of the General Public License, Version 2. You can find the full text in the `LICENSE` file in this repository.

The build system is based on the [OBS Plugin Template](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate). Its build instructions also apply to this plugin.

Huge credits also go to pkv from OBS who implemented a similar filter in OBS for NVIDIA GPUs. His code was referenced heavily in the creation of this plugin, especially during the early stages.
